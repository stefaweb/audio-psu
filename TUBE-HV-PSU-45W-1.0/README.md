# TUBE-HV-PSU-45W-1.0

Published June 1st 2025

The TUBE-HV-PSU PCB is a power supply for audio tubes that supports high-voltage power supply modules such as the HV-MODULE-UC3845, which you can find in another directory of my GitHub repository. It also supports the Chinese XIPA-650CHVCX module with some component modifications.

In addition to the positive and negative (BIAS) high-voltage outputs, it also has a 12V auxiliary output.

The Gerber files are available in the file TUBE-HV-PSU-Gerber-1.0.zip and the BOMs in the file TUBE-HV-PSU-BOM.html (to be opened with an Internet browser).


Size: 110x130mm
