# HV-MODULE-UC3845-1.0

<b>DC-DC High Voltage 50W Power Supply</b>

Under development.

<b>Specifications:</b><br>
Input: 24V<br>
Positive Output: +180V to +500V<br>
Negative Output: -80V to -200V (no load, only for tube BIAS)<br>
Overcurent protection<br>
Overtemperature protection<br>
Softstart (1 second by default but more by adding high value capacitor in C13')<br>
3A fuse protection<br>
Possibility to generate a negative voltage on the main output by modifying a few components (inverter mode).<br>
<br>
<b>Real-life testing</b><br>
Output ripple at 350V 60mA: 130mV (45mV with TUBE-HV-PSU-45W power supply mother board)<br>
24V input consumption at 350V 60mA: 1A<br>
230V AC input consumption at 350V 60mA: 26W<br>
Heatsink temperature: 40Â°C<br>

Size: 80x50mm
