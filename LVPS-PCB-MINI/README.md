# LVPS-PCB-MINI

The LVPS-PCB-MINI is a general purpose PCB to be used with popular DC-DC setup up or step down Chinese modules like the XL4015 or the XL6009.

I developed this PCB to generate 6.3Vdc for heating the KT88 tube filaments for one of my Tube Amplifier but it is especially interesting because it supports many DC-DC module models allowing it to be used to generate various voltages.

The PCB (90x44mm) works with a simple diode bridge. The capacitor C2 and C3 has a maximum D13 diameter. The maximum value that fit is 7500uF 10V.

The LVPS-PCB-MINI have been tested with these DC-DC modules:

- Step-Down XL4015 Blue model 

- Step-Down HW-468 (TPS40057) fixed 5V (easy to put a pot)

- Step-Up XL6009 Basic Blue model (capacitors 100uF/220uF)

- Step-Up XL6009 Red Extended model (capacitors 220uF/220uF + more HF filtering + small inductor)
