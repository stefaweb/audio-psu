# HV-MODULE-UC3845-MAX-1.0

<br>
<b>HV-PSU-UC3845-MAX version compared to first HV-PSU-UC3845 1.1</b>

- Support power up to 65W (need an external 75W AC-DC power supply).
- New voltage ouput range: 120-485V
- NewPCB  size 50 x 100 mm.
- New default Mosfet IRF1010EZ (produce less heat, cheaper)
- New optimized component values ​​around the UC3845A (C1, C2, C5, R1, R5).
- Removed negative parts and specific dedicated footprint
- New output LCL filter with one electronic capacitor footprint before the coil and two footprints after the coil.
- Possibility to use an TH or SMD coil.
- Footprint for output filter electronics capacitor now accept D12.5.
- Mosfet can be installed at botton or below the PCB (to fit on a larger heatsink)
- The GND and B+ signals are duplicated on the output connector.
- The diode footprint now supports DO-201 and a TO-220.
- New mother board for power it up to 45W.
